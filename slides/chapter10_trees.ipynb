    "A tree is a finite set of nodes. The set might be empty (no nodes, which is called the empty tree). But if the set is not empty, then it must follow these rules:\n",
    "   1. There is one special node, called the root.\n",
    "   2. Each node may be associated with one or more different nodes, called its children. If a node c is the child ofanother node p, then we say that “p is c’s parent.”\n",
    "    3. Each node except the root has exactly one parent; the root has no parent.\n",
    "    4. If you start at any node and move to the node’s parent (provided there is one), then move again to that node’s parent (provided there is one), and keep moving upward to each node’s parent, you will eventually reach the root."
